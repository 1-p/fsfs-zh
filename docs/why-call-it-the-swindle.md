1. Why Call It the Swindle? {#why-call-it-the-swindle .chapter}
===========================

为何称之为诈骗（Swindle）？
===========================

I go out of my way to call nasty things by names that criticize them. I
call Apple’s user-subjugating computers the “iThings,” and Amazon’s
abusive e-reader the “Swindle.” Sometimes I refer to Microsoft’s
operating system as “Losedows”; I referred to Microsoft’s first
operating system as “MS-Dog.”[(1)](#FOOT1) Of course, I do this to vent
my feelings and have fun. But this fun is more than personal; it serves
an important purpose. Mocking our enemies recruits the power of humor
into our cause.

我有意地用具有批判性的名字来称呼龌龊的东西。我将苹果的迫使用户屈从于它们的计算机称为“iThings”，而将亚马逊的虐待读者的电子书阅读器称为“诈骗”（Swindle）。有时我将微软的操作系统称为“Losedows”，而将微软的第一款操作系统称为“MS-Dog”[(1)](#FOOT1)。当然，我如此做是为了表达自己的不满以及作为消遣。然而这种消遣并不是个人层面的，它服务于一项重要目的。通过嘲讽我们的敌人，我们可以将幽默的力量注入我们的事业。

Twisting a name is disrespectful. If we respected the makers of these
products, we would use the names that they chose…and that’s exactly the
point. These noxious products deserve our contempt, not our respect.
Every proprietary program subjects its users to some entity’s power, but
nowadays most widely used ones go beyond that to spy on users, restrict
them and even push them around: the trend is for products to get
nastier. These products deserve to be wiped out. Those with DRM ought to
be illegal.

扭曲名字是一种不尊重对方的行为。如果我们尊重这些产品的制造商，我们将会使用它们所选定的名字……并且那将是恰如其分的。这些恶意的产品只配得到我们的鄙视而非我们的尊重。每一款私有软件迫使其用户屈从于某些实体的权力，但如今最常用的私有软件已经不限于窥探用户和限制用户，甚至是任意摆布用户：趋势是这些产品正在变得越来越龌龊。它们理应被消灭干净，其中带有数字限制管理（DRM）的产品应该被判定为非法。

When we mention them, we should show that we condemn them, and what
easier way than by twisting their names? If we don’t do that, it is all
too easy to mention them and fail to present the condemnation. When the
product comes up in the middle of some other topic, for instance,
explaining at greater length that the product is bad might seem like a
long digression.

当我们谈论它们的时候，我们应当表达出我们对它们的谴责，那么，还有什么方式比扭曲它们的名字更容易呢？如果我们不如此做，就很可能在称呼它们的同时未能表达出我们的谴责。例如，当它们出现在某些其他话题之中时，下笔千言来解释它们为什么是坏的，就会显得离题万里。

To mention these products by name and fail to condemn them has the
effect of legitimizing them, which is the opposite of what they call
for.

点名谈论这些产品但未能表达出我们的谴责，将会产生使其合法化的反效果，这是与它们所应得的谴责正好相反的。

Companies choose names for products as part of a marketing plan. They
choose names they think people will be likely to repeat, then invest
millions of dollars in marketing campaigns to make people repeat and
think about those names. Usually these marketing campaigns are intended
to convince people to admire the products based on their superficial
attractions and overlook the harm they do.

Every time we call these products by the names the companies use, we
contribute to their marketing campaigns. Repeating those names is active
support for the products; twisting them denies the products our support.

Other terminology besides product names can raise a similar issue. For
instance, DRM refers to building technology products to restrict their
users for the benefit of someone else. This inexcusable practice
deserves our burning hatred until we wipe it out. Naturally, those
responsible gave it a name that frames the issue from their point of
view: “Digital Rights Management.” This name is the basis of a public
relations campaign that aims to win support from entities ranging from
governments to the W3C.[(2)](#FOOT2)

To use their term is to take their side. If that’s not the side you’re
on, why give it your implicit support?

We take the users’ side, and from the users’ point of view, what these
malfeatures manage are not rights but restrictions. So we call them
“Digital Restrictions Management.”

Neither of those terms is neutral: choose a term, and you choose a side.
Please choose the users’ side and please let it show.

Once, a man in the audience at my speech claimed that the name “Digital
Rights Management” was the official name of “DRM,” the only possible
correct name, because it was the first name. He argued that as a
consequence it was wrong for us to say “Digital Restrictions
Management.”

Those who make a product or carry out a business practice typically
choose a name for it before we even know it exists. If their temporal
precedence obligated us to use their name, they would have an additional
automatic advantage, on top of their money, their media influence and
their technological position. We would have to fight them with our
mouths tied behind our backs.

Some people feel a distaste for twisting names and say it sounds
“juvenile” or “unprofessional.” What they mean is, it doesn’t sound
humorless and stodgy—and that’s a good thing, because we would not have
laughter on our side if we tried to sound “professional.” Fighting
oppression is far more serious than professional work, so we’ve got to
add comic relief. It calls for real maturity, which includes some
childishness, not “acting like an adult.”

If you don’t like our choice of name parodies, you can invent your own.
The more, the merrier. Of course, there are other ways to express
condemnation. If you want to sound “professional,” you can show it in
other ways. They can get the point across, but they require more time
and effort, especially if you don’t make use of mockery. Take care this
does not this lead you to skimp; don’t let the pressure against such
“digression” push you into insufficiently criticizing the nasty things
you mention, because that would have the effect of legitimizing them.
