 {This essay was originally published on <http://gnu.org>, in 2000. This
version is part of @fsfsthreecite} Names convey meanings; our choice of
names determines the meaning of what we say. An inappropriate name gives
people the wrong idea. A rose by any other name would smell as sweet—but
if you call it a pen, people will be rather disappointed when they try
to write with it. And if you call pens “roses,” people may not realize
what they are good for. If you call our operating system Linux, that
conveys a mistaken idea of the system’s origin, history, and purpose. If
you call it GNU/Linux, that conveys (though not in detail) an accurate
idea.

顾名则思义；我们所选的名字代表了我们所要传达的思想。一个不恰当的名字会向人们传递错误的思想。玫瑰不管叫什么闻起来总是甜的——但是如果你把它叫作笔，当人们用它写字时将会很失望。同样地，如果你把笔叫作“玫瑰”，人们可能就不知道它们能做什么了。如果你把我们的操作系统称为“Linux”，则会传达一些关于系统起源、历史和目的的错误概念。如果你称之为GNU/Linux，这将传达（虽然不详细）一个准确的概念。

Does this really matter for our community? Is it important whether
people know the system’s origin, history, and purpose? Yes—because
people who forget history are often condemned to repeat it. The Free
World that has developed around GNU/Linux is not guaranteed to survive;
the problems that led us to develop GNU are not completely eradicated,
and they threaten to come back.

这对我们的社区重要吗？人们是否了解系统的起源、历史和目的重要吗？是的——因为忘记历史的人往往要注定要重蹈覆辙。围绕 GNU/Linux 而开发出来的自由世界是不安全的；迫使我们开发 GNU 的问题并没有被彻底根除，而且他们总是想复辟

When I explain why it’s appropriate to call the operating system
GNU/Linux rather than Linux, people sometimes respond this way:

当我解释为什么把这个操作系统称为“GNU/Linux”比“Linux”要好时，人们有时这样回应：

> Granted that the GNU Project deserves credit for this work, is it
> really worth a fuss when people don’t give credit? Isn’t the important
> thing that the job was done, not who did it? You ought to relax, take
> pride in the job well done, and not worry about the credit.

> 就算 GNU 工程因其工作而应该得到赞誉，但如果人们不给予它这种赞誉，就真的值得如此大惊小怪的吗？不管是谁做的，反正工作被完成了，这不是重要的事吗？你应该心态平和，以干好工作为荣，而不是对荣誉的问题耿耿于怀。 

This would be wise advice, if only the situation were like that—if the
job were done and it were time to relax. If only that were true! But
challenges abound, and this is no time to take the future for granted.
Our community’s strength rests on commitment to freedom and cooperation.
Using the name GNU/Linux is a way for people to remind themselves and
inform others of these goals.

这似乎是个明智的建议，如果所有的情况都像那样，大家干完工作后都不计得失，那这建议还真是对的！但现实充满挑战，现在还不是那样对未来想当然的时候。我们社区的力量靠的是自由与合作的保证。使用GNU/Linux这个名字是一种让人们用来提醒自己和他人了解这些目标的方式。

It is possible to write good free software without thinking of GNU; much
good work has been done in the name of Linux also. But the term “Linux”
has been associated ever since it was first coined with a philosophy
that does not make a commitment to the freedom to cooperate. As the name
is increasingly used by business, we will have even more trouble making
it connect with community spirit.

虽然不考虑 GNU 也能写出优秀的自由软件；许多优秀的工作是在 Linux 的名义下完成的。但是“Linux”（这个名字）从它被创造的那一刻起，就与一种不对自由协作做承诺的哲学联系在一起。随着这个名字的广泛商业使用，当我们把它和社区精神相联系时，将会遇到更多的麻烦。

A great challenge to the future of free software comes from the tendency
of the “Linux” distribution companies to add nonfree software to
GNU/Linux in the name of convenience and power. All the major commercial
distribution developers do this; none limits itself to free software.
Most of them do not clearly identify the nonfree packages in their
distributions. Many even develop nonfree software and add it to the
system. Some outrageously advertise “Linux” systems that are “licensed
per seat,” which give the user as much freedom as Microsoft Windows.

对自由软件来说，未来的一大挑战是来自于那些“Linux”发行版公司，为提高易用性和增强功能，将非自由的软件添加到 GNU/Linux 中。他们中的大多数都在其发行版中没有区分非自由软件包。很多甚至开发非自由软件并加入到其系统发行中。还有些甚至蛮横的地宣布那些“Linux“系统是“席位许可”的，也就是可以给用户和 Microsoft Windows 一样的“自由”。

People try to justify adding nonfree software in the name of the
“popularity of Linux”—in effect, valuing popularity above freedom.
Sometimes this is openly admitted. For instance, Wired magazine said
that Robert McMillan, editor of Linux Magazine, “feels that the move
toward open source software should be fueled by technical, rather than
political, decisions.”And Caldera’s CEO openly urged users to drop the
goal of freedom and work instead for the “popularity of
Linux.”[(1)](#FOOT1)

人们用“普及 Linux ”的名义替这种加入非自由软件的行为辩护—事实是，更重视普及度而不是自由。有时这是公开承认的。例如，《连线》杂志（Wired）对 Linux 杂志的编辑 Robert McMillan 说，“感觉推动开源软件应该用技术，而不是政治决策”。并且 Caldera 的 CEO 公开劝说用户放弃自由的目标，并转而为“普及 Linux”而工作[^1]。

Adding nonfree software to the GNU/Linux system may increase the
popularity, if by popularity we mean the number of people using some of
GNU/Linux in combination with nonfree software. But at the same time, it
implicitly encourages the community to accept nonfree software as a good
thing, and forget the goal of freedom. It is not good to drive faster if
you can’t stay on the road.

如果普及率指使用混合非自由软件的 GNU/Linux 的用户数量，添加非自由软件到 GNU/Linux 系统或许会增加普及率。但同时，它含蓄地鼓励社区将非自由软件当好东西接受，而忘记自由的目标。如果你的方向不对，那车开得再快也没用。

When the nonfree “add-on” is a library or programming tool, it can
become a trap for free software developers. When they write free
software that depends on the nonfree package, their software cannot be
part of a completely free system. Motif and Qt trapped large amounts of
free software in this way in the past, creating problems whose solutions
took years. Motif remained somewhat of a problem until it became
obsolete and was no longer used. Later, Sun’s nonfree

当非自由的“插件”是一种库或者编程工具时，就会成为自由软件开发者的陷阱。当他们编写基于非自由软件包的自由软件时，他们的软件不能成为完全自由系统的一部分。Motif 和 Qt 曾以这种方式诱骗了大量的自由软件，导致的问题花费数年才能解决。Motif 的问题仍然没有完全解决。Sun的非自由的Java实现现在也有类似的效果：Java 陷阱[^2]，庆幸的是大多已经修复。

Java implementation had a similar effect: the Java Trap,[(2)](#FOOT2)
fortunately now mostly corrected. If our community keeps moving in this
direction, it could redirect the future of GNU/Linux into a mosaic of
free and nonfree components. Five years from now, we will surely still
have plenty of free software; but if we are not careful, it will hardly
be usable without the nonfree software that users expect to find with
it. If this happens, our campaign for freedom will have failed.

如果我们的社区持续向这个方向发展，将会把 GNU/Linux 的未来引到自由和非自由拼接在一起的地步。从现在起的五年里，我们仍然确信将会有大量的自由软件产生；但如果我们不小心，用户所期望的自由软件就很难在脱离非自由软件的情况下使用。如果这事发生了，我们为自由做出的努力就前功尽弃了。

If releasing free alternatives were simply a matter of programming,
solving future problems might become easier as our community’s
development resources increase. But we face obstacles that threaten to
make this harder: laws that prohibit free software. As software patents
mount up, and as laws like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act are used
to prohibit the development of free software for important jobs such as
viewing a DVD or listening to a RealAudio stream, we will find ourselves
with no clear way to fight the patented and secret data formats except
to *reject the nonfree programs that use them.*

如果发布自由的替代品只是简单的编程问题，随着我们社区开发资源的增加，未来解决问题可能的就变得愈加简单。但是我们面临的障碍使得这更加困难：法律禁止自由软件。当软件专利上升），并且像 DMCA 这样的法律被用来阻止开发一些用于重要工作中的自由软件时（例如看 DVD 或者听 RealAudio 音频流），我们会发现，除了**拒绝使用那些用到非自由的程序**，我们自己没有明确的方法来抵御专利和私密的数据形式。

Meeting these challenges will require many different kinds of effort.
But what we need above all, to confront any kind of challenge, is to
remember the goal of freedom to cooperate. We can’t expect a mere desire
for powerful, reliable software to motivate people to make great
efforts. We need the kind of determination that people have when they
fight for their freedom and their community—determination to keep on for
years and not give up.

面对这些挑战需要许多不同的努力。但是应对任何挑战，我们首先需要牢记自由协作的目标。我们不能期待用仅仅强大、可靠的软件来激励人们作更多的努力。我们需要大家有一种决心，一种为他们和社区的自由而战的决心——一种锲而不舍的决心。

In our community, this goal and this determination emanate mainly from
the GNU Project. We’re the ones who talk about freedom and community as
something to stand firm for; the organizations that speak of “Linux”
normally don’t say this. The magazines about “Linux” are typically full
of ads for nonfree software; the companies that package “Linux” add
nonfree software to the system; other companies “support Linux” by
developing nonfree applications to run on GNU/Linux; the user groups for
“Linux” typically invite salesmen to present those applications. The
main place people in our community are likely to come across the idea of
freedom and determination is in the GNU Project.

在我们的社区里，这个目标和决心主要源自 GNU 工程。我们就是这样的人——把自由和社区当作不可让步的事情；而那些称之为“Linux”的组织通常不说这些。关于“Linux”的杂志更是打满了非自由软件的广告；打包“Linux”的公司把非自由软件添加进系统；其它公司通过开发非自由的应用来“支持 Linux”；连“Linux”的用户群也邀请推销员展示这些应用。人们在社区中的有可能碰到自由的理念喝决策的主要地方，就是在 GNU 工程中。

But when people come across it, will they feel it relates to them?

但是当人们碰到它时，能体会到这与他们息息相关吗？

People who know they are using a system that came out of the GNU Project
can see a direct relationship between themselves and GNU. They won’t
automatically agree with our philosophy, but at least they will see a
reason to think seriously about it. In contrast, people who consider
themselves “Linux users,” and believe that the GNU Project “developed
tools which proved to be useful in Linux,” typically perceive only an
indirect relationship between GNU and themselves. They may just ignore
the GNU philosophy when they come across it.

那些知道自己正在用的系统是源自 GNU 工程的人，能看到他们自身与 GNU 之间有一个直接的关系。他们不会自动地同意我们的哲学，但是至少他们将看到一个严肃思考它的理由。相反，那些认为自己是“Linux 用户”的人，相信 GNU 工程只是“开发了被证实在 Linux 中非常有用的工具”，他们通常只了解 GNU 与其间接关系。当他们接触到 GNU 哲学时，就会忽视它。

The GNU Project is idealistic, and anyone encouraging idealism today
faces a great obstacle: the prevailing ideology encourages people to
dismiss idealism as “impractical.” Our idealism has been extremely
practical: it is the reason we have a free GNU/Linux operating system.
People who love this system ought to know that it is our idealism made
real.

GNU 工程是理想主义的，但是那些鼓励理想主义的人面临很大的障碍：普遍的意识形态鼓励人们把理想主义当作“不现实的”而摒弃。我们的理想主义其实已经极其实用：这是我们拥有一个自由的 GNU/Linux 操作系统的原因。喜欢这个系统的人应该知道，正是我们的理想主义实现了它。

If “the job” really were done, if there were nothing at stake except
credit, perhaps it would be wiser to let the matter drop. But we are not
in that position. To inspire people to do the work that needs to be
done, we need to be recognized for what we have already done. Please
help us, by calling the operating system GNU/Linux.

如果“工作”真的做了，如果除了信誉没有其他利害攸关，也许放弃可能会更明智。但是我们没有处在那个境地。为了鼓励人们做那些需要做的工作，我们需要使我们已经做了的工作被认可。请将这个系统称为 GNU/Linux 来帮助我们吧。
