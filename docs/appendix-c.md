**C:** The Free Software Song {#c-the-free-software-song .unnumbered}
=============================

The lyrics of “The Free Software Song” are sung to the melody of the
Bulgarian folk song “Sadi moma bela loza.” To listen to a recording of
the piece accompanied by Bulgarian instruments played in traditional
style, please visit\
 <http://gnu.org/music/FreeSWSong.ogg>. @firstcopyingnotice{{This song
is in a rhythm of 7/8; those unaccustomed to odd rhythms often take the
unevenness to be a mistake. The meter can be analyzed into three
subgroups as slow-quick-quick or 3-2-2. Such meters in Bulgarian music
can often be stretched, and some musicians analyze this song as 3-2-3
instead; however, the last “3” is not as long as the first. Yves Moreau,
who collected and taught the dance, endorses the rhythm of 7.\
